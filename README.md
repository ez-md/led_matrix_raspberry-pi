#YouTube Live Subsciber Counter 
This uses a raspberry pi and an LED Matrix to display subscriber count of youtube account. 

It can also be used to view any messages.

In my example, it shows a one time welcome message, current time, Youtube Channel name and the subcriber count. Then it loops back to the time.
