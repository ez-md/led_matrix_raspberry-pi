#YouTube Live Subsciber Counter 
This uses a raspberry pi and an LED Matrix to display subscriber count of YouTube account. 

It can also be used to view any messages.

In my example, it shows a one time welcome message, current time, YouTube Channel name and the subscriber count.Then it loops back to the time. 

## Required 
+ Python3
+ pip
+ any Raspberry pi with Raspbian installed
+ LED matrix [Like this one](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-MAX7219-Arduino-Microcontroller-Display/dp/B07FFV537V?ref_=ast_sto_dp)
